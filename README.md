 Welcome to The Biggest Catch, growing up my mom would take me fishing and we would catch some of everything!
 We also took many trips that i wish i could remember, to one day take my kids.
 Sadly I have bad memory, which inspired me to create this application!
 The Biggest Catch allows users to keep a log of fishing trips they have taken, along with the fish they caught because HOW COULD WE FORGET OUR BIGGEST CATCH?!
